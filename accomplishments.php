                        <p>I am an accomplished lifeguard, water safety instructor, and lifeguard instructor. People try to drown around me so that I can save them. Awwww! <br><br> Once, when I was lifeguarding at a summer camp lake, I had to evacuate the campers from the water because a child had spotted what he described as "a huge turtle". Kid wasn't joking, the dude must've been 75 pounds and a foot and a half across. <br><br> It took three lifeguards with a fishing net to corral the turtle into a trash can filled with water. We tried to flip the can upright and out of the lake, but it became clear that the turtle was too big to lie flat in the can. Eventually we got the creature into a full size rowboat, turned out that was the only thing we had at the beach that could contain the monster.
